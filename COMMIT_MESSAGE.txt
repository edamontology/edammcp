refactor(models): reorganize models by functionality and improve segmentation API

This commit refactors the models submodule to organize models by functionality
rather than by request/response type, making the codebase more intuitive and
maintainable. It also introduces a proper request/response pattern for the
segmentation functionality and renames fields for better clarity.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Models are now organized by feature (mapping, suggestion, segmentation, workflow)
- ReadyForMapping renamed to SegmentationResponse
- SegmentationResponse fields renamed: top_concept -> topic, chunks -> keywords
- segment_text() now requires SegmentationRequest instead of raw string

Model Organization:
- Created edam_mcp/models/mapping.py
  * Contains MappingRequest, MappingResponse, and ConceptMatch
  * All mapping-related models grouped together
  
- Created edam_mcp/models/suggestion.py
  * Contains SuggestionRequest, SuggestionResponse, and SuggestedConcept
  * All suggestion-related models grouped together
  
- Created edam_mcp/models/segmentation.py
  * Contains SegmentationRequest and SegmentationResponse
  * Replaces the old segment.py file
  
- Deleted edam_mcp/models/requests.py
  * MappingRequest and SuggestionRequest moved to their respective modules
  
- Deleted edam_mcp/models/responses.py
  * All response models moved to their respective feature modules
  
- Deleted edam_mcp/models/segment.py
  * Replaced by segmentation.py with improved naming

Segmentation API Improvements:
- Added SegmentationRequest model
  * Contains single 'text' field with validation (min_length=1)
  * Follows consistent naming convention with other request models
  
- Renamed ReadyForMapping to SegmentationResponse
  * More descriptive name that clearly indicates it's a response model
  
- Renamed SegmentationResponse fields:
  * top_concept -> topic (more concise and clear)
  * chunks -> keywords (more accurate description of content)

Code Updates:
- Updated all imports across codebase:
  * edam_mcp/main.py
  * edam_mcp/tools/mapping.py
  * edam_mcp/tools/suggestion.py
  * edam_mcp/tools/segment_text.py
  * edam_mcp/tools/workflow.py
  * edam_mcp/ontology/matcher.py
  * edam_mcp/ontology/suggester.py
  * tests/test_mapping.py
  * tests/test_segment.py
  * examples/basic_seg.py
  * examples/simple_test.py

- Updated edam_mcp/models/__init__.py
  * Exports all models from new locations
  * Maintains backward compatibility through __all__ exports

- Updated segment_text() function signature
  * Now accepts SegmentationRequest instead of raw string
  * Improved type safety and consistency with other tools

Documentation:
- Updated docs/developer/architecture.md
  * Documented new model organization structure
  * Added SegmentationRequest to model listings
  
- Updated docs/developer/api.md
  * Updated import examples to use new module paths
  * Reflects new segmentation API structure

Testing:
- Updated all test cases to use SegmentationRequest
- Added test_segment_text_empty_validation() to verify Pydantic validation
- Renamed test_segment_text_empty() to test_segment_text_minimal()
- All 32 tests passing

Benefits:
- Improved code organization: related models grouped together
- Better discoverability: easier to find models for a specific feature
- Consistent naming: all features follow {Feature}Request/{Feature}Response pattern
- Enhanced type safety: segmentation now uses proper request model
- Clearer field names: topic and keywords are more intuitive than top_concept and chunks
